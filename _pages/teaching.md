#### <span style="color:#b509ac">Introduction to Numerical Methods for Engineering </span>
Teaching Assistant, Stanford University  
Spring 2020, Spring 2021, Spring 2022

Numerical methods from a userâ€™s point of view. Lagrange interpolation, splines. Integration: trapezoid, Romberg, Gauss, adaptive quadrature; numerical solution of ordinary differential equations: explicit and implicit methods, multistep methods, Runge-Kutta and predictor-corrector methods, boundary value problems, eigenvalue problems; systems of differential equations, stiffness. Emphasis is on analysis of numerical methods for accuracy, stability, and convergence. Introduction to numerical solutions of partial differential equations; Von Neumann stability analysis; alternating direction implicit methods and nonlinear equations.

Director of Teacher Training, Stanford University  
2019 - 2024

[SeeME](https://seeme.stanford.edu) is the official Stanford Mechanical Engineering outreach club. As Director of Teacher Training, I created and taught workshops for Stanford graduate students on how to plan interesting and accessible classes for middle- and high-school students in the surrounding community. Workshops were created in collaboration with the Stanford [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.stanford.edu/) using evidence-based and inclusive learning and teaching practices.
