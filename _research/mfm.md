Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) are textured hydrophobic surfaces which have the ability to trap air pockets when immersed in water. This can result in significant drag reduction, due to the substantial effective slip velocity which forms at the surface. We seek to understand the difference in using a homogenized slip (Navier slip length) boundary condition and pattern-resolved slip boundary condition in the context of momentum mixing.

<!-- SHS figure -->

The macroscopic forcing method (MFM) is a statistical technique that allows for direct measurement of the nonlocal eddy viscosity operator from DNS data. We use MFM to compare the eddy viscosity operators of a turbulent channel over patterned SHS of both boundary conditions in the limit of large pattern wavelength.

We futher extend the evaluation of nonlocal eddy viscosity to consideration of a nonlocal slip length operator. Though the slip length boundray condition has, in the past, been limited to dependence on local velocity gradients at the surface, we show that it can also depend on velocity gradients in a layer with finite thickness.

The usage of our measured nonlocal eddy viscosity and slip length operators significantly improves solutions to the Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations.

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
