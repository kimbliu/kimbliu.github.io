  abstract={This work uses data from direct numerical simulation (DNS) to examine the drag-reduction potential of different surfaces generated from a Miura-origami basisâ€”folded, creased material structures with no tearing. Miura surfaces span a wide set of possible realizations but presently are deployed to emulate optimized drag-reducing riblets. Flexibility of the Miura fold also permits modified surfaces that transform traditional straight riblets by including an additional streamwise wavelength, i.e., triangular riblets with streamwise waviness. As such, we report the drag-reduction characteristics of a set of Miura surfaces to identify optimal configurations. To build confidence in our findings, code-to-code verification is performed by comparing two flow solvers that perform DNS of a separate, complex, highly skewed Miura-fold roughness topology. Comparing their respective output statistics, a good level of agreement is observed. Returning to the drag-reducing wavy riblets, turbulence quantities are collected to explore modulation of dynamical scales through premultiplied energy spectra. The literature shows that dynamically oscillating walls are able to deplete streaks in the streamwise turbulent fluctuations, but until now the efficacy of the passive analogue had been unknown. Further, alignment of near-wall structures with the wavy surface topology is visualized and quantified to reveal the wall-normal extent to which the wall may affect turbulence. The primary objective of this work establishes the potential for static wavy Miura surfaces to enhance drag reduction as compared to classical straight riblets. Drag decomposition reveals that the role of a thickening viscous region is responsible for the shift in observed performance. This is a first step toward actuated dynamic origami surfaces in a drag-reduction context.}
