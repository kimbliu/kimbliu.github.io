  abstract={Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) are patterned hydrophobic surfaces that reduce skin friction drag via the entrapment of air pockets when immersed in water. A common technique for measuring skin friction of external boundary layers in an experimental setting is the Clauser chart method, which infers shear stress by assuming a log region characteristic of smooth walls. We present modifications to the Clauser method to account for SHS, motivated by the modified Clauser method proposed for rough walls (Perry and Li 1990). The performance of the modified Clauser method for SHS is evaluated against DNS data of SHS simulations with the homogenized slip length boundary condition. The skin friction predictions from the modified Clauser method are shown to be accurate for a range of slip lengths, with minimal error compared to direct measurements. The accuracy and efficiency of the modified Clauser method for SHS are promising for its potential as a nonintrusive measurement tool of SHS drag reduction.}

  title={Influence of Miura-origami shapes on drag in turbulent flows},

  abstract={This work uses data from direct numerical simulation (DNS) to examine the drag-reduction potential of different surfaces generated from a Miura-origami basisâ€”folded, creased material structures with no tearing. Miura surfaces span a wide set of possible realizations but presently are deployed to emulate optimized drag-reducing riblets. Flexibility of the Miura fold also permits modified surfaces that transform traditional straight riblets by including an additional streamwise wavelength, i.e., triangular riblets with streamwise waviness. As such, we report the drag-reduction characteristics of a set of Miura surfaces to identify optimal configurations. To build confidence in our findings, code-to-code verification is performed by comparing two flow solvers that perform DNS of a separate, complex, highly skewed Miura-fold roughness topology. Comparing their respective output statistics, a good level of agreement is observed. Returning to the drag-reducing wavy riblets, turbulence quantities are collected to explore modulation of dynamical scales through premultiplied energy spectra. The literature shows that dynamically oscillating walls are able to deplete streaks in the streamwise turbulent fluctuations, but until now the efficacy of the passive analogue had been unknown. Further, alignment of near-wall structures with the wavy surface topology is visualized and quantified to reveal the wall-normal extent to which the wall may affect turbulence. The primary objective of this work establishes the potential for static wavy Miura surfaces to enhance drag reduction as compared to classical straight riblets. Drag decomposition reveals that the role of a thickening viscous region is responsible for the shift in observed performance. This is a first step toward actuated dynamic origami surfaces in a drag-reduction context.}
